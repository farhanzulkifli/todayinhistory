Challenges faced/Lesson learnt:
1) I should have read through the libraries more thoroughly, especially Timeline.js, so that debugging would have been much easier.
2) Finding the right API is key. Initial API was broken and fixing it was so time-consuming that finding a different API was a better idea.
3) Time management is key, I should have strived to create more functions rather than digging deeper into something that I could not solve. I should be more decisive.
4) Things that was intended to be added in:
Previous and next days buttons to view days without going back to main page.
A download function to download a particular date image.
Source for an API that could include videos and other medias.
add in a date range to the timeline so that everything does not load.
Look for an image API that could load things based on keywords on the page.
5) Do not reinvent the wheel, if someone has done it, leverage.
